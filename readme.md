# Mars Rover

This is a coding challenge. 

## About

Use yarn to install the dev dependencies.
This project is made up of logic in ```src``` folder, and tests to validate the logic in ```___tests___``` folder.

The logic main function resides in ```src/landRovers.ts```, encapsulating the overall goal, separate tasks have their own subfiles (parseLandingInput.ts, landRover.ts).
Each of the files has it's respective counterpart in tests folder. The tests use test data supplied from ```testData/testDataSet.js```. The data set is derrived from the coding challenge assignment, and may be replaced by a different set in appropriate format. Some of the tests do not require any test data.
The logic aims to work on any input with valid format, with variable plateaus dimensions, amount of actions or deployed rovers.

## Usage

See package.json for commands.

run ```test``` to execute the tests.
